# Biconomy SDK Configs

This is a repository of config files for the Biconomy SDK. You can learn more about the SDK and all of its offerings on the [docs](https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/introduction/overview)


## How to use

To use each configuration, simply copy and paste the code into the corresponding configuration file in your project. Refer to the instructions below to learn how to get started with each file.

## Next JS Configuration

Create a Next JS application using a template of your choice or by utilizing the [Create Next App CLI](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app).

Copy and paste the contents of next.config.js into your own config file. No additional dependencies will need to be installed. 

## Vite Configuration React/Vue

Create a React or Vue project using the [Vite CLI](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). 

This repository contains two files: 

`react.vite.config.ts`

and 

`vite.vite.config.ts`

If you are using React use the first configuration and for Vite use the latter.
